# Cub3D

**Cub3D** is a project developed at 42. The goal of this project is to create a 3D game using the Raycasting technique, similar to the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. This project teaches fundamental concepts of computer graphics, game development, and algorithms in C.

## Project Objectives

- **Raycasting**: Implement the Raycasting technique to render a 3D view from a 2D map.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Utilize the MiniLibX library for rendering graphics and handling window events.
- **Game Mechanics**: Develop basic game mechanics such as player movement and collision detection.
- **File Parsing**: Read and parse configuration files to generate game maps.
- **Optimization**: Optimize the rendering process for smooth performance.

## Features

- **3D Rendering**: Use Raycasting to render a 3D perspective view from a 2D map.
- **Player Movement**: Implement movement controls for the player, including forward, backward, and rotational movement.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect and handle collisions with walls to prevent the player from walking through them.
- **Texture Mapping**: Apply textures to walls for a more realistic appearance.
- **MiniMap**: Display a 2D minimap showing the player's position and surroundings.
- **Configuration File**: Load game settings and map layout from a `.cub` file.
